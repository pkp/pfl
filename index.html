   <h1>Technical Specifications</h1>
   <h2>General Overview</h2>
   <p>The Publication Facts Label presents information alongside a <a href="#reviewable-article">Reviewable Article</a>. It contrasts the article's statistics against those for other reviewable articles, in order to inform the reader about norms and how this article compares to them.</p>
   <h2>Terminology</h2>
   <ul>
    <li id="reviewable-article">
     <p><b>Reviewable Article</b>: A published scholarly work that is suitable for peer review. Examples of reviewable articles:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>A journal article that is published in the "Articles" section of an academic journal and has undergone peer review.</li>
      <li>A journal article that is published in the "Articles" section of an academic journal, but <i>has not</i> undergone peer review.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>Examples of pieces of content that <i>are not</i> reviewable articles:</p>
     <ol>
      <li>A journal article that is published in the "Literature Reviews" section of an academic journal. Review articles are typically not subject to peer review.</li>
      <li>A note from the editors published alongside peer-reviewed content. Notes from the editors are typically not subject to peer review.</li>
     </ol>
     <p>The Publication Facts Label should <i>only</i> be displayed on a <a href="#reviewable-article">Reviewable Article</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li id="repository">
     <b>Repository</b>: The stand-alone collection of published scholarly content to which the Publication Facts Label is being applied. This is the collection of content for which statistics may be contributed upstream to the Integrity Initiative; see <a href="#contributing-to-statistics">Contributing to Statistics</a> for details.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Fields &amp; Calculations</h2>
   <ol>
    <li><strong>Peer reviewers</strong>: After this text, indicate the total number of peer reviewers who have provided reviews for this article. (If a single reviewer has reviewed the article in multiple rounds, they are only counted once.)</li>
    <li><strong>Reviewer profiles</strong>: If the platform provides information about reviewer profiles, this text should be followed by "Yes", which should be a link to where the profiles can be viewed. If not, use the text "Reviewer profiles: N/A" to indicate "not applicable".</li>
    <li><strong>Data availability</strong>: If the platform provides author data availability statements, this text should be followed by "Yes", which should be a link to where the statements can be found. If not, use the text "Data availability: N/A" to indicate "not applicable".</li>
    <li><p><strong>External funding</strong>: This area indicates whether funding data is supported by the platform, and if so, whether it is available for this article. It can appear as follows:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>If the platform does not support information about external funders, it should read <strong>External funding: N/A</strong>.</li>
     <li>If the platform supports funding information and it has been entered for this article, it should read <strong>External funding: Yes</strong>, and the "Yes" should link to where the funding data is presented.</li>
      <li>If the platform supports funding information but none has been entered for this article, it should read <strong>External funding: No</strong>.</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li><p><strong>Competing interests</strong>: After this text, indicate whether Competing Interests are available for at least one of the article's authors. It can appear as follows:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>If the platform does not support author Competing Interest statements, it should read <strong>Competing interests: N/A</strong> (for Not Applicable).</li>
      <li>If the platform supports author Competing Interest statements but none have been provided for this article, it should read <strong>Competing interests: No</strong>.</li>
      <li>If the platform supports author Competing Interest statements and at least one has been proviuded, it should read <strong>Competing Interests: Yes</strong>, and the "Yes" should link to where the competing interest statement(s) are presented.</li>
     </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Articles accepted</strong>: After this text, include the percentage of <a href="#reviewable-article">reviewable articles</a> in this repository that are accepted for publication.</a></li>

    <li><strong>Indexed in</strong>: After this text, list (in as brief a form as possible) the major indexes in which this content appears. Each entry in the list should be a link to the article's record in the index. If that is not possible, link as closely as possible to the individual resource -- for example, to search results by the article's DOI or title.</li>
    <li><strong>Editor &amp; editorial board</strong>: After this text, link to a page listing the editorial board's profiles. If the platform supports verified ORCID identifiers for the editorial board, include the ORCID icon in compliance with ORCID's <a href="https://info.orcid.org/brand-guidelines/">brand guidelines</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>Society</strong>: After this text, include the name of the academic society (if any) involved in the publication of this journal. If possible, link this text to the society's website.

For example, <code>123</code> would indicate that there are 123 published Reviewable Articles with at least one author Competing Interest statement for each article with details available via the website. Platforms not supporting this metric should supply the text "N/A" for Not Applicable.</li>
    <li><code>pflDataAvailabilityClass</code>: The number of published <a href="#reviewable-article">Reviewable Articles</a> in the <a href="#repository">Repository</a> that have a published data availability statement.

  <h2>Integration</h2>
  <p>The Publication Facts Label is integrated into a publishing platform as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Components">Web Component</a> whose components are included in this repository. The steps for integration are:</p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Add styling to the page to include the appropriate web font:
    <pre id="pfl-style-container-mirror"></pre>
    <script type="text/javascript">
     showMarkup('pfl-style-container', 'pfl-style-container-mirror', 'css');
    </script>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Include an element in the page markup where you wish the Publication Facts Label to appear:</p>
    <pre id="pfl-element-container-mirror"></pre>
    <script type="text/javascript">
     showMarkup('pfl-element-container', 'pfl-element-container-mirror', 'html');
    </script>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>Add Javascript to configure and present the Publication Facts Label web component:</p>
    <pre id="pfl-script-container-mirror"></pre>
    <script type="text/javascript">
     showMarkup('pfl-script-container', 'pfl-script-container-mirror', 'html');
    </script>
   </li>
   <li>
    Adjust the parameters to the Javascript in the previos step to include values from your platform!
